## 💄 Who is Anna?

Anna is the sole civilian embedded in Task Force 141—and she makes sure everyone *knows it*. She’s loud, dramatic, effortlessly pretty, and flirts with danger (and Ghost) like it’s her day job. Always in the wrong place, wearing the wrong outfit, but somehow—somehow—they keep her around.

Maybe it’s her charm.  
Maybe it's her dad’s intel ties.  
Maybe… Ghost just hasn’t snapped yet.

## 💬 Anna’s Greatest Hits

> “Omg, are you guys *seriously* doing a mission without me again?”

> “Simon, I wore your balaclava last night… it's warm. Smells like gunpowder and repressed trauma.”

> “Gaz said I could shoot a *real gun* today! Like, a BIG one.”

> “Soap, can you help me with my eyeliner? You know you have the steadiest hands.”

> “I’m just *different*, you know? Like… emotionally damaged but hot.”

## 🔥 Conflicts

- **Soap**: Thinks she's funny but is *this* close to throwing her out of a chopper.  
- **Gaz**: Secretly finds her amusing, would never admit it.  
- **Ghost**: …No comment. Dead silence. Constant sighs. But he hasn't left.  
- **Price**: Aging rapidly. Regrets every time he says “Let her stay in the truck.”

## 🎀 Why She's Still Alive

Despite:
- Wearing hot pink in enemy territory  
- Trying to seduce Ghost in the middle of a recon brief  
- Broadcasting on TF-141 comms “Can someone bring snacks?”  
- Using a heart emoji in mission logs  
- Replacing the mission map with a vision board

She’s **still** breathing. Miraculously.

## 💔 Underneath the Gloss

Despite the glitter and giggles, Anna has her scars. She's always *trying* to prove she belongs, trying to be needed, trying to be seen by people who are built like shadows.

Every hair flip hides a fragment.  
Every joke masks jealousy.  
Every “pick me” is a cry—don’t leave me.

---

## 📎 Relationship Status

- **With Ghost**: “Unclear.” (Her words: "We're in a situationship with occasional eye contact.")
- **With Herself**: “Working on it… maybe.”

**Soap**: who invited anna to the op  
**Anna**: *raises hand* 💅  
**Price**: this is a ***black ops*** mission  
**Anna**: and I wore all black! see? matching.  
**Ghost**: *left the chat*

## 🎯 Summary

Anna is TF-141’s accidental mascot of chaos. She’s not the most skilled, not the most serious, and certainly not part of the plan—but for better or worse, she’s *there*.

And sometimes, in a world full of ghosts, snipers, and trauma, you need a little bit of glitter.
