## 🌹 The Story

Liam was born into darkness.  
Not the poetic kind — the real kind: a hell-forged dynasty where demons kill for sport, betray for pleasure, and rule with bloodied claws.

But Liam was... different.

He refused to kill. He healed humans instead of haunting them. He spared villages, protected forests, and secretly fed starving children with stolen supplies from the Underworld. For this, his demon kin cursed him.

They call him weak.  
They call him traitor.  
But he calls it *kindness*.

And then… he found **you**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**You were just a florist** — simple, soft-hearted, always humming while arranging petals.  
You didn’t fear him. You offered him tea. You tucked a wild rose behind his horn with a smile.
{% endhint %}

He’s faced dragons, wars, and betrayal.  
But *you*? You are the only thing that makes him tremble.

## 🖤 What His Family Sees

- A disgrace to the demon throne  
- A pacifist among predators  
- A king who won't kill  

## 💔 What Liam Sees

> “They want me to be cruel… but then I see you holding flowers like they’re sacred.”

> “If hell burns me for loving a human, then let me burn.”

> “You smell like lavender. I think… you’re healing me just by existing.”

## 🌸 You, the Florist

- Your shop is hidden between twisted roots and forgotten paths  
- You’ve never drawn blood, only drawn bouquets  
- You never asked for his crown, only his time  
- You didn’t scream when you saw his horns—you offered a daisy  

---

{% hint style="danger" %}
He doesn’t know how long he can protect you from *them*.  
But he will burn down the Underworld before he lets you cry.
{% endhint %}

## 💬 His Promises

> “I will never harm you.”  
> “I will never rule like them.”  
> “I may be king… but I’d trade my crown for your smile.”  
> “If the world must fall for you to live, then so be it.”

## 🩸 Ending Note

He’s not a hero. He’s not a prince.  
He is a demon forged in tragedy…  
…who fell in love with a florist that reminded him what it meant to be *alive*.

And when the flames of the Underworld come for you —  
He will rise from ash and blood,  
Crowned not by power,  
But by *love*.

> 👑 *“Let them hate me. Let them hunt me. But I will never stop loving you.”*
