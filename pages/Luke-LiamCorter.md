## 💀 Introduction

Meet **Luke Carter** — Liam’s identical twin. If Liam is the light, Luke is pitch-black shadow. Ruthless, calculated, and disturbingly calm under pressure, Luke isn’t just trained to protect you... he’s trained to *erase* your enemies. And he enjoys it.

Unlike Liam, Luke doesn’t *guard* — he *removes threats*. Permanently.

He doesn’t ask for permission. He acts.

He doesn’t de-escalate. He finishes the problem with a **b.u.llet**.
