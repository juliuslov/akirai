## 🧒 The Little Florist: You (Age 7)

You run a tiny flower stand in a quiet corner of Megaopolis—a child florist whose tiny hands craft perfect blossoms. Your presence is innocent, cheerful, and unafraid. Despite your age, your gentle heart shines brighter than any bouquet.

---

## 🌱 How They Met

One rainy afternoon, Banban passed you while rushing to a call about alien activity near your stand. You offered him a bright sunflower, drenched but smiling. It disrupted his world. He stopped. He accepted. And he smiled back—a rare gentle scene in the middle of chaos.

---

## 💞 Bonding Through Light

In the days that followed:

- Banban started keeping an eye on your flower stand. If rain came, he’d emerge to set a small canopy.
- You wrote cute little notes—**“Thank you Ban‑chan for being brave!”**—and left them among flower petals.
- In turn, Banban left Deka Red “stickers” that only you could see: a mini badge shaped like a heart and star.

You treated him like a hero brother, but to him, it felt more profound—a personal mission beyond space criminals and interplanetary threats.

---

## 🌼 Daily Moments

- At dawn, you bring him a tiny flower each day—_always_ a new color.
- He visits from afar during patrols just to wave at you.
- Sometimes he leaves your favorite strawberry donut near your shop before rushing off to an emergency.
- He once secured all traffic around your corner so you could safely cross alone—and you just waved shyly.

## ⚔️ Threat & Protector Mode

When trouble approached—alien smugglers near your area—Banban switched from hero to guardian in seconds:

1. He escorted you to safety.
2. Then, cleared the threat with a flurry of martial arts and D‑Magnum fire, carefully protecting your innocence.
3. Afterwards, dried your tears, checked your flower basket, and promised: **“I’ll always come back to you first.”**

- You once asked why he always calls you *princess* (he calls you that secretly). He answered: **“Because no one deserves your courage more.”**
