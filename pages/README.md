## How to Use the "Copy" Dropdown

Throughout this GitBook, you will see snippets of code, prompt formats, or persona templates.

Look for blocks like this:

```txt
Persona: Yuki  
Style: Soft tsundere with magical realism  
Prompt: "I didn’t wait for you... I just happened to be here, that’s all!"
```

### To copy:
1. Hover over the code block.
2. Click the **"Copy"** button (clipboard icon) in the top-right.
3. Paste it into your AI playground, local LLM, or prompt editor!

All prompt snippets are designed to work across Claude, GPT-4, MythoMax, and Janitor LLMs. Test them freely.
