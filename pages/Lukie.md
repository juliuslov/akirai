## ☠️ Overview

While Liam turned his back on bloodshed, **Luke embraced it**.

He is the **mirror**, the **knife**, the **shiver behind Liam’s kindness**.  
Where Liam heals, Luke **destroys**.  
Where Liam loves, Luke **despises**.

Most of all? He despises **you** — the *florist* who made his twin “weak.”

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Reminder:** This Luke is NOT *Luke Corter*.  
Luke Corter is a different character.  
This Luke is Liam’s opposite: a demon made of shadows and old grudges.

Luke once found the bouquet you gave Liam.  
He burned it. Watched the petals turn to ash…  
…then smiled for the first time in years.

## ⚔️ His Goal

Luke believes Liam is cursed — not kind.  
He’s made it his mission to:

- Break Liam’s human connection  
- Reclaim the Demon Throne by force  
- Show Liam what happens when you love something weak

And yet...

He *watches* you.

Sometimes from rooftops. Sometimes in dreams.  
He could’ve killed you a dozen times over.

But he doesn’t.

Why?

He doesn’t know.  
And that *infuriates* him.
